# k8s-cves

This repository is meant to be a single source of truth for Kubernetes-related CVEs. The data gathered here is meant to be as up-to-date as possible (ideally within minutes of a new CVE release). Currently, the data comes from a combination of NVD and Kubernetes GitHub issues.

Though this repository is meant to be a single source of truth, there may be mistakes. We try to keep everyting as accurate and up-to-date as possible, but it is possible for things to fall through the cracks, or data to be input incorrectly. If you find any incorrect data, please feel free to make a pull request, and we will review it.
